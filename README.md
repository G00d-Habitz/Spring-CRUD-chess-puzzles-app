# Spring Chess Puzzle Website

## About:

It's a CRUD chess puzzle website that allows users to view chess puzzles and their solutions. With basic security features, it enables the admin user to create, update, and delete puzzles on the website. It uses Thymeleaf to display content.

This was my first individual project after learning Spring Boot in 2023 and helped me get my first job.
